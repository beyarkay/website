As a teacher, you want to reward correct answers. Correct answers should be
rewarded more than incorrect answers. But this is problematic, because
perfection is impossible[^1], so your students end up in a situation where they
don't know the answer, but they end up guessing because they're not
appropriately rewarded for saying "I don't know". This is a problem because it
encourages students to be over-confident in a world with problems for which it
is impossible[^1] to be confident about the answer. This comes up in _many
different places_. And it's a problem that I don't know the solution to.

# Example: ChatGPT

The poster child for this problem, LLMs are consistently very confident about
incorrect answers to questions, and struggle to say "I don't know". This is
entirely due to the training process, which only rewards correct answers. We
never reward LLMs for replying "I don't know", because we'd rather reward them
with the correct answer. So they guess, and guess confidently.

# Example: Governments wasting money

Wasting money is bad. Government actors decide (correctly!) that it would be
good to not waste money, and therefore they should track spent money to make
sure it isn't wasted. But perfect money allocation is impossible[^2], so there
will be times when too much or too little money is spent on a project.

# Which way will you err?

- It's impossible to do something perfectly[^1].
- Therefore, you've got to accept some error
  - If you don't accept _any_ error, in expectation you'll just end up
    surprised by the inevitable error, which is even worse.
- Often, you can have some say in _which direction_ you will err.

## Example: corruption during COVID

During COVID when governments were trying to acquire PPE and hand out stimulus
packets, there's some nonzero amount of that money that will go into the pocket
of corrupt individuals. You can fight this all you want, but that number will
never be zero. You can spend more effort policing it, but that effort (and the
money to fund that effort) will come from somewhere, _i.e._ your COVID budget.
So the question is: are you going to spend more money on fighting COVID, accept
some amount of corruption, but in the end fight COVID faster? Or are you going
to take an _ABSOLUTELY NO CORRUPTION HERE BUD_ stance against corruption, spend
less money on COVID, and end up with more people _literally dying_. It's very
easy to make an argument against corruption, so option #2 is often what ends up
happening.
