[ListenToAnything.com](https://listentoanything.com) lets you convert any
website, PDF, blog post, or article into a podcast episode that gets uploaded to
your own custom podcast feed. If your reading list only ever seems to get
longer, this is for you <3.

My podcast feed is `https://ListenToAnything.com/@brk.xml`. I've
pasted that link into my podcast app, so the app automatically downloads new
episodes. I can create a new episode my simply adding `listentoanything.com/`
to the front of any website.

For example, to listen to Nick Bostrom's Fable of the Dragon Tyrant, I can go
to the website `https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon`, then add the prefix to
the URL: `listentoanything.com/https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon`, and then
I'll see my podcast app start downloading the episode in about 2 minutes. It's
great, give it a go [here](https://listentoanything.com).
