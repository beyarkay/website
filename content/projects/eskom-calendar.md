[Eskom-calendar][1] was an open source project I created and maintained for ~2 years
until (thankfully) its raison d'Ãªtre ceased to be. At its peak, it had 60k
downloads per week and received national media recognition. Oh, and it's
written in Rust, btw.

# The problem

Imagine this: You're going about your daily life when suddenly, your power goes
out. Not because of a fault or emergency, but because it's scheduled to happen.
This is loadshedding - South Africa's solution to prevent the entire national
power grid from collapsing due to insufficient electricity supply.

Eskom (the national power utility) divides each day into blocks where different
areas take turns going without electricity. There are multiple "stages" of
loadshedding, from Stage 1 (least severe) to Stage 8 (most severe). As the
stages increase, the frequency and duration of power cuts increase. At Stage 6,
which is common, an area might have no power for 4.5 hours at a time, multiple
times per day.

On top of this, the national power utility is hopelessly disorganised and the
schedules announcing when your power will be cut off are only available in
literally one of hundreds of PDF documents. There is no API. There are no CSVs.
There _might_ be an inconsistently formatted Excel spreadsheet, if you're
lucky. Oh, and did I mention that the only way official announcements are made
is via _screenshots on Twitter_? These are not once-a-month announcements.
These are "the entire schedule has changed" announcements, made every 3 days.

As you might imagine, it's nigh impossible to organise your life around this.
You don't know if you'll be able to cook a warm dinner when you get home. South
African's don't have a gas line into their homes, so you can't use a gas stove
to cook. You don't know if your internet will go down in the middle of an
important video meeting. Even if _you_ have power, your ISP might not have
power in which case you're also out of luck. Your laundry is going mouldy
because you can't find enough time to let the laundry-machine finish. You milk
is going bad within two days because the grocery store can't keep it
refrigerated all the time.

# The solution

This is where `eskom-calendar` becomes crucial. It helps people:

- Know exactly when their power will be off based on their specific area
- Plan their daily activities around guaranteed power times
- Get notifications before power cuts so they can prepare (charge devices, cook meals, etc.)
- Automate systems (like backup power) based on the schedule
- Share accurate schedule information with employees, clients, or family members

Without tools like eskom-calendar, people would need to manually check complex
schedules and calculate their power cut times - a time-consuming and
error-prone process that becomes especially difficult when stages change
frequently. The package essentially turns a complex, frustrating system into
manageable, actionable information that helps people maintain some normalcy in
their daily lives despite the challenges of loadshedding.

# Technical details (because it's kinda neat)

I'm pretty happy with how Eskom-calendar worked under the hood. I was a poor
college student at the time, this was explicitly a zero-income project, and it
might end up running for years. I needed something with zero running costs, and
this requirement lead to some... _interesting_ business choices that lead to
actually interesting technical choices.

## How Eskom announces loadshedding

How Eskom implemented loadshedding is politically motivated which makes it
technically complicated. Basically, Eskom itself does not declare "everyone
living in suburb Foobar, your power will be off from 5pm to 7pm today", because
Eskom is a national institution and merely sells power to the municipalities,
which in turn sell power to everyday people. Because of this decoupling, what
actually happens is:

1. Eskom forecasts that there will be more demand for electricity than they can
   supply
2. Eskom publishes a tweet announcing that the country will move from stage 0
   (no loadshedding) to stage 4 (heavy loadshedding) from 5pm to 7pm this
   evening.
3. Individual municipalities are then in charge of converting "stage 4" to
   "your power will be off from 5pm to 6pm if you live in this suburb".
4. In practice, this meant each municipality published massive PDFs of tables
   filled with tiny writing describing which areas would be affected by
   loadshedding at which times and on which dates.

This decoupling _directly_ lead to a massive amount of confusion, as Eskom
would change the loadshedding stage approximately every three days (due to
incompetent management and political tomfoolery). Every time the stage changed,
_literally everyone in the country_ would have to cross reference the new stage
with what their municipality published.

## Automatic updating via GitHub actions

From the start, I wanted to use internet calendar subscriptions. This started
as a personal project, and I wanted to view power outages in my calendar
alongside my meetings, plans, and whatnot. This way, I'd be able to schedule
around loadshedding without having to open a different app or manually parse
dates like "Monday 08:00-10:30 Stage 1, Tuesday 10:00-12:30 Stage 2, Tuesday
18:00-20:30 Stage 1" into something that I could cross reference against my
calendar.

A few things came together to make this project work nicely:

1. The Internet Calendar spec ([RFC5545][2]) is plain text, making it
   incredibly easy to work with and understand.
2. All calendar apps (Apple Calendar, Outlook, Google Calendar) allow you to
   "subscribe" to a calendar by providing a URL. The calendar app will then
   query that URL at some frequency[^1] and display the updated list of events
   to the user.
3. GitHub has a "Releases" feature which allows you to upload ~arbitrary files
   and host them at a consistent URL.
4. GitHub also provides GitHub Actions which allows you to do ~arbitrary work
   on their machines, optionally triggered by ~arbitrary events.

All of this means that once I wrote code to ingest a schedule and output `.ics`
files, I could use GitHub Actions to create those `.ics` files from the input
schedule and GitHub Releases to host the calendars. Then the user just has to
copy the GitHub Releases URL, paste it into their calendar app, and they've got
up-to-date loadshedding information for life. And I (a poor college student)
don't pay a cent.

## Unseen complexity

Ah but we're not done yet. Having code to create an `.ics` file from a
[JSON or YAML](yaml_for_the_haters) file that describes the schedule is _easy_.

The problem is, there is no single schedule. There are two schedules, and we're
interested in the intersection between them. Specifically, there's the
announcements that Eskom publishes via twitter, saying something like [this
tweet](https://x.com/Eskom_SA/status/1765365800251125890):

![[tweet.jpg]]

(If it looks painfully bureaucratic, that's because it is).

I would manually[^2] parse this image into a machine-understandable form
like (truncated):

```yaml
changes:
    - stage: 2
    start: 2024-03-06T16:00:00
    finsh: 2024-03-06T20:00:00
    source: https://twitter.com/Eskom_SA/status/1765365800251125890
    exclude: coct
    - stage: 4
    start: 2024-03-06T20:00:00
    finsh: 2024-03-07T05:00:00
    source: https://twitter.com/Eskom_SA/status/1765365800251125890
    exclude: coct
...
```

This list of `change`s[^3] is not where the party ends, however. Because this
just tells you that you'll be in "stage X" at this and that time. It doesn't
tell you _when your damn lights will be out_. To convert a list of `change`s
into a list of power outages, we'll need to get information from the
municipalities about what "stage X" means for any given region.

There's an API for that, right?

Oh no? Well, there's like, a CSV file, right?

Oh also no? But there's an Excel spreadsheet or something, right? _right?_

In actual fact, there's about 700 individual regions in South Africa, and
almost all of them have slightly different loadshedding schedules that map
stages onto hours during a day without power. Each municipality (there are many
municipalities in South Africa) handles this slightly differently:

- Some schedules repeat every week. Some repeat every month. Some repeat every
  10 days. Some repeat every 19 days (I have no idea why 19 is special).
- Some municipalities have Excel spreadsheets, some have PDFs, some have PDFs
  that contain _screenshots of Excel spreadsheets_. Eskom themselves handle a
  few special loadshedding areas, in which case you have to download their excel spreadsheet
  and use Excel macros and formulae to select your region, the stage, and then
  view your area's schedules.
- There is no consistent ID schema to identify the different areas in South
  Africa. Each place has a name, but because _history_, some places have
  multiple names, some have legacy names, and some are in the process of
  changing their names. And of course, many places have the same name.

So I went through these 700 different regions and converted them to CSV files,
looking something like:

```csv
date_of_month ,start_time ,finsh_time ,stage
            1 ,00:00      ,02:30      ,    2
            1 ,00:00      ,02:30      ,    3
            1 ,00:00      ,02:30      ,    4
            1 ,00:00      ,02:30      ,    5
...
```

or (for weekly repetitions):

```csv
day_of_week ,start_time ,finsh_time ,stage
          1 ,18:00      ,20:00      ,    7
          1 ,18:00      ,20:00      ,    8
...
```

or (for weird repetitions):

```csv
day_of_cycle ,period_of_cycle ,start_of_cycle ,start_time ,finsh_time ,stage
           1 ,             19 ,2023-09-15     ,06:00      ,08:30      ,    2
           1 ,             19 ,2023-09-15     ,06:00      ,08:30      ,    3
           1 ,             19 ,2023-09-15     ,06:00      ,08:30      ,    4
           1 ,             19 ,2023-09-15     ,06:00      ,08:30      ,    5
           1 ,             19 ,2023-09-15     ,06:00      ,08:30      ,    6
...
```

These CSV files and the YAML file can then be combined to find the intersection
of the two: if there's a `change` saying stage 1 from 08:00 to 11:00, and your
area has loadshedding today at stage 1 from 09:00 to 11:30, then your power
will be off from 09:00 to 11:00. Yes, there were _lots_ of weird edge cases to
figure out here.

## Using rust in production

This, honestly, was one of the best ideas I made. I just used rust because I
wanted to use rust, but once the code compiled it was _solid_. I don't think it
ever broke on me for a reason that wasn't a logic bug. Paired with enough tests
to ensure the logic is working, I felt incredibly confident in the code I
wrote. Absolutely would recommend. As an aside, there's a non-trivial amount of
work to be done in order to read ~700 CSV files, find the intersections, and
then write ~700 ICS files. Rust gobbles these files up like a champ. This isn't
exactly a time-sensitive matter, but it's really nice knowing you're not
waiting for a slow language.

[^1]:
    Annoyingly, Google calendar's frequency is anywhere between 0 and 48
    hours. This caused problems during the busy periods when Eskom was updating
    their schedules more than once a day, as users would have out-of-date
    information.

[^2]:
    "but why didn't you automate this" LLMs are good, but even they can't
    deal with inherent ambiguity. _Many_ times, Eskom would announce an
    incomplete or incoherent schedule (ie "Stage 1 10:00 to 12:00, stage 2
    11:30 to 12:30"). In which case I end up DM'ing some folks to try get them
    to sort their stuff out. There is no API. There is no automatically-updated
    file. _I_ am the API. _I_ am the one providing the automatically-updated
    file.

[^3]:
    Naming these objects `changes` was incredibly confusing, but it was part
    of the public API and I didn't realise it was a bad idea until it was too
    late to change without breaking other people's code. `announcements` would
    have been a better word for what they are.
