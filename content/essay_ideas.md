## Ideas

- Filters: How its good to have tight filters if they mean that you can spend
  less time on things that wouldn't work out anyway: see Investors, potential
  dates, etc. It's good to be polarising in your beliefs when looking for a
  partner because you'll quickly exclude those people who you wouldn't want to
  date anyway. It might feel like you get fewer matches, but you're ensuring
  that the matches you _do_ get are more likely to be compatible.
- False Dichotomies are disguised distributions: Often questions which are
  phrased as "is X better than Y" are actually just distributions of risk and
  the two options have similar means but vastly different minimums/maximums.
  Ceilings and floors.
- Promotion to incompetence: people get promoted when they do good, and they
  don't get promoted when they don't. So people high up tend to be really bad
  at their jobs, because they got promoted a bit but now no longer are good
  enough to be promoted. This also happens with programming languages and
  hardware capabilities: we write code at the maximum of our ability (why would
  you do anything else) but that means that we're at the breaking limit.
  There'll always be shit code, because as soon as a new language or
  abstraction comes about that allows developers to write more complex code, it
  gets pushed until we're at our breaking limits again. _And this is the best
  of bad options_. Hardware, too, suffers this problem. As hardware gets more
  powerful, we write code to take advantage of that power. And so everything
  gets nicer, faster, more capable. But then suddenly all that extra power is
  being used to give us rounded corners on our windows and Chrome runs at
  15fps. So what's the answer? I suspect it has to come from outside the
  system.
- Accessibility should be treated like language servers. Each person should get
  a client that enables the things they want and interacts well with their
  disability, and then every device should provide a server protocol that
  accepts commands from the accessibility device.
- The stories they don't let you hear: Talk about the idea space of books being
  greater than that of movies, because more people's OK are required to make a
  movie than a book and there's more chance that a fringe idea will get turned
  down. Then talk about how very few books would get published about scandals
  in the publishing industry, because Moloch ensures that the publishing
  industry is a self serving beast which ensures its own survival. If it _did_
  allow for publishing scandals to get published, then it would be torn down
  and replaced with something else. this would replace until something came
  along that did the publishing and either 1) didn't have scandals (unlikely)
  or 2) didn't make those scandals public. This is visible everywhere, but it's
  invisible everywhere else. Social media companies are well known for
  censoring what they put out, as are dictatorships, but just about everything
  else does something similar. If there's an entity that has control of
  distributing stories to many many people, then there'll be very few stories
  going against that entity.
