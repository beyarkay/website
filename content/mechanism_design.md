title: Solving for incentives and Mechanism Design
tags: [mechanism-design]

If game theory tries to solve the question:

> Given a system of incentives X, what is the optimal strategy for agents in the system?

Then solving incentives (AKA [mechanism
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design)) seeks to solve this
question:

> Given that we want agents in our system to act like Y, what incentives can we
> put into the system that make this their optimal strategy?

This comes up in many varied places.
