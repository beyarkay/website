If you recognise someone from a talk they gave, make sure you have as much
information as possible to help them connect you to that talk. The worst thing
would be if you mention the talk, and they can't distinguish it from the dozens
of other talks, and then what could have been an interesting connection is
something mildly more awkward than a blind introduction.
