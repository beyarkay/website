Some things have no purpose. They contribute nothing of substance, they are
explicitly a waste of time, and the opportunity cost of doing these things is
massive. Lawyers wearing suits is an example of this: wearing a suit does not
literally increase their knowledge of the law, although I'll argue that there
exist things or people or traditions whose sole purpose is to be a burden, and
that this is a useful purpose. An object can be defined as "this thing is a
waste", and the existence of that object will be useful to the person
or organisation that owns the object.

Wasteful objects convey meaning: I am wealthy or powerful enough to waste
wealth or power on this object.
