I like solving incentives, also known as [mechanism
design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanism_design) in Economics. This can
be seen as the counterpart to game theory. If game theory tries to solve the
question:

> Given a system of incentives X, what is the optimal strategy for agents in the system?

Then mechanism design seeks to solve this question:

> Given that we want agents in our system to act like Y, what incentives can we
> put into the system that make this their optimal strategy?
