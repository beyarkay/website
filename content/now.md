Right now I'm interested in and working on:

- Full-time employment as an Embedded Systems Engineer at CubeSpace, building
  attitude determination and control systems for satellites (I write the code
  that makes satellites spin real good).
- [ListenToAnything.com](listentoanything.com), a service that lets you convert
  any webpage/PDF into a podcast episode, so you can listen to your reading
  list and actually close some of those open tabs. I discuss the goals behind
  it in more detail [here](listentoanything.md).
- Independent AI Safety Research
- Organising AI Safety Stellenbosch, a branch of [AI Safety Cape Town](https://www.aisafetyct.com/)
- Organising meetups in Cape Town to discuss and learn about the Rust
  programming language.

Please reach out! I'm interested in talking with interesting people, even if
you don't know exactly what to talk about.
