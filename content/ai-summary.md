The "AI debate" isn't really one debate, it's a confusing network of arguments
and counter arguments that do or do not contain implicit assumptions, all
tangled up with overloaded terms and conflicting definitions. So let's tidy it
up a bit, shall we?

# The Questions

Some arguments that I know exist, but I haven't found any proponents/opponents
for yet:

- Generalisation to patterns is all anything is. Matching on patterns lets you
  classify cat pictures, but also lets you answer in human language and become
  intelligent.
- It's possible for non-human things to be conscious
- It's possible for computers to be conscious
