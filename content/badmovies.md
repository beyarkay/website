Movies are different to books. And I don't mean that in a clich√© way, I mean
that the range of ideas that a book can convey is different from the range of
ideas that a movie convey. I can substantiate this with a theoretical
experiment, although I expect to be able to substantiate it with empirical
evidence as the semantic understanding of long-form content (via LLMs and other
ML models) improves.
