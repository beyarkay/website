# AGI

Artificial General Intelligence, generally something that is at least as
capable as a human at all economically meaningful tasks. This used to be just

straight past that milestone, and many will disagree with that definition.

# ASI

Artificial Super Intelligence, generally something that is more capable than
humans in all economically meaningful tasks.

# NASI

Artificial Super Intelligence, generally something that is more capable than
humans in a small subset of economically meaningful tasks.
