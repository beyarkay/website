Dario complaining about how lots of people seem to dislike maths because of
how it was taught, and laments at how if only maths education could be better
then not as many people would dislike maths. But what if the price for having
many good mathematicians is to force feed it to lots of kids so that they
either really love it or really hate it? What if, in making fewer kids hate
maths, you end up also making fewer kids _love_ maths? Ceilings and floors:
you can either have many kids kinda liking maths (but very few mathematical
savants) or you can have many kids despising maths but some kids absolutely
adoring maths. And I'd argue that specialisation is the thing we need here.
Breakthroughs don't come from 100 people who take mathematics in their first
year. Breakthroughs come from 5 people who completed their Maths PhDs.

And this speaks to a greater problem: Breakthroughs come from a small number
of specialists, not from a large number of generalists (and if you're going
to talk about multi-disciplinary research, then I'm going to say that your
"generalists" are really just specialists in multiple fields). And if we
focus society on producing specialists, then a breakthrough enabling society
necessarily has many specialists in their own fields complaining that "if
only there were more of us", not realising that in this case, we want to
maximise the performance of the 99th percentile, not the 50th percentile.

It isn't always the case that we want to maximise the 99th at the expense of
the 50th. Global health is an example where we really don't give a fuck if the
people at the 99th percentile of health are doing really well despite the vast
majority of the population suffering in pain and dying of curable maladies. But
it's often phrased as do X or do Y, despite the reality being that we want to
raise the floor. It's generally a good idea to ensure that nobody can be
suffering in pain and malnourished, even if that means that little Timmy has to
endure his headache for an extra couple of hours. Of course this isn't the
explicit choice that you or I make, but Moloch is hard at work here making
these decisions for us. People in the bottom percentile of health (or wealth
for that matter) generally don't have the bargaining power to improve their
situation (and definitely not to the same degree as people in the top
percentile have the power to improve their situation). So if you're the unlucky
1 in 100 with the worst health, you're at the mercy of those above.

Another example of this would be high level vs low level programming languages.
High level languages generally result in a higher median performance; it is
hard to write really terrible code in a high level language due to the
safeguards implied by the language being high level. Low level languages
(assembly, C) generally have a higher maximum performance, but lower minimum
performance. You can really cause some problems if your Assembly is poorly
written or incorrect, but you'll struggle to default while writing Fizz Buzz
in Python. The natural caveat for programming languages, is that they suffer a
promotion towards incompetence.

It seems possible that having children is like this too, although as a
childless 20-something I don't really have the experience to say anything
conclusively. But having children is talked about as giving immense purpose and
bringing joy watching your children grow up. But simultaneously brings the
stress of caring and paying for those children, as well as the stress of
children disagreeing with parents and fighting and otherwise growing up to
become independent human beings. So it certainly seems from the outside like
having children will make you both happier and sadder.
