Predicting the future is not hard. Or more precisely, there are many times
when, even accounting for hindsight bias, it would have been very easy to
predict outcomes.

Usually this is for big things, government COVID responses for example. At the
start of COVID, it would have been reasonable to predict that there's some
small chance of a worldwide shutdown, and that sometime after that shutdown
there would be a vaccine. Predicting anything more detailed than that is
tricky, but even with the very coarse (possibly low-confidence, depending on
when you're making the prediction) predictions of "there will be a shutdown" or
"there will be a vaccine", it's possible to take positive EV actions.

So why don't we?

Hearing people talk about this, it seems that there's a lot of "I just didn't
think about it". So let's figure out a systematic way of thinking about large
events and how they'll affect the future, because systems solve human problems.

First off, we should pay attention to "big" events. The size of "big" doesn't
really matter, but the bigger the event the more likely it is to have an impact
on our lives that we can use to take a positive EV action.
